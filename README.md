## 🪟 Overview:

In this project, conducted with Power BI for the FP20 Analytics Challenge 14, I explored the dynamics of ⛽ Argentina's fuel prices from 2016 to 2023.

Utilizing Power BI's robust capabilities, I embarked on cleaning, modeling, exploring, and visualizing the comprehensive dataset to unearth critical insights.

The dataset employed for this intricate analysis is part of the **FP20 Analytics Challenge 14** 👉🏼🗃️ [⛽National Fuel Market Analytics DataSet](https://www.fp20analytics.com/challenges)

The data modeling stage involved the creation of a relational data model that reflects the relationships between products, company, sales, shift.
